# mbuino_template
Template for building mbuino project using arm gcc tools

This has a single project.  You will need to 

* Install gnu arm tools
* Download and build the mbed sdk.
* Edit Makefile.common to point LIBROOT, CORE, USB to the right directories
* make

This has only been tested on the included blinky program.  Some work remains to get a working USB example
